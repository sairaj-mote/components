# Components

## Overview

These components are based on HTML5 custom elements API. This is an attempt to unify UI development patterns and elements that are used multiple times throughout any general web app.It uses 'sm' namespace for all components. So every component tag starts with ***'sm-'.***

They can replace some older UI elements like `<select>` `<input>` `<input type="checkbox">` `<button>` But also more modern additions like Carousels, Popups(modals), Tabs and more.

### features
- Based on [Custom Elements API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) which means it's a web platform standard that can be used in various popular frameworks like ***React***, ***Vue***, ***Angular*** etc.
- ***Keyboard and Touch friendly*** Multiple ways to interact with every components.
- ***Standalone*** Every component can be used seperately on its own with all the functionality encapulated.
- ***Easy styling*** styling of components is handled by [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). Also CSS of components is encapsulated in shadow DOM so it won't affect styling of rest of the app.
- ***Relative Sizing*** These components use relative units `rem` and `em` to resize them. Changing default font size of `<body>` will resize components according to screen size.

Some components have some cool tricks under their sleeves like custom events and variantions. They allow developers to access more information about component or simply react to whatever state change happen to them. We will go more in-depth about all the variantions and customs events related to each event as we go further.

## Quick Start
To start using these Components

### Download

- Download [components.js from here](https://github.com/sairaj-mote/components).
- Place components.js file in your project directory;
- Link js with `<script src=".../components.js"></script>` at bottom of your HTML file just before closing `</body>` tag.

### Styling

Every component responds to some CSS variable that needs to be set in order to start using them.

```css
--accent-color: teal;
--text-color: 24, 24, 24;
--foreground-color: 255, 255, 255;
--error-color: #E53935;
```

 css variable | function
 --- | ---
 `--text-color` | default text color for all components.
 `--foreground-color: 255, 255, 255;` | generally color around a component.
 `--error-color: #E53935;` | you can specify custom color for error messages and icons.

***!!! It's important to set only comma separated rgb values with `--text-color` and `--foreground-color` css variables.*** 

Now you are ready to use them in your HTML markup as any other standard HMTL tags ðŸ˜„.

### Buttons
[See Demo](https://sairaj-mote.github.io/components/)

```html
<sm-button>Default</sm-button>
```

`<sm-button>` are very similar to standard HTML `<button>`. You can add anything between opening `<sm-button>` and closing `</sm-button>` just like traditional button.

#### Variants
Variants are different stylistic versions of same component, But they have same functions.

1. Primary
```html
<!-- Primary button with accent colored background -->
<sm-button variant="primary">Primary</sm-button>
```
2. Outlined
```html
<!-- Outlined button with accent colored outline -->
<sm-button variant="outlined">Outlined/sm-button>
```
3. No outline
```html
<!-- No outline button with accent colored text -->
<sm-button variant="no-outline">No Outline</sm-button>
```

#### Disabled State

These can disabled adding `disabled="true` attribute. That makes them look in-active but they still will receive events. ***Thats why it's important to only use it's custom event to listen for click event*** more on that further. 
```html
<sm-button disabled="true">Disabled</sm-button>
```
#### Custom Events

1. `clicked` is a custom event specified for `sm-button` that listens to button being clicked like normal `click` event. The main difference being `click` event will fire even if `disabled="true"` is set as sm-button doesn't stop actual component from receiving pointer events. The reason being it has another event to handle disabled state.  

2. `disabled` event fires when button is disabled and user tries to click on it. This event can be useful if you want to validate a form but user clicked submit before all data so you show message according to situation.

#### Is it ***Responsive***?

No, As by default this is an inline element that means it won't strech accross whole horizontal space. But this behaviour can be changed that by following css.
```css
sm-button{
  width: 100%;
}
```

#### Accessibility

```

`<sm-strip-select>` is very similar to standard HTML `<select>` in terms of general markup and options. If you want to add an option then you have to use `<sm-strip-option></sm-strip-option>` instead of `<option>`. 

#### Syntax 
```html

No, As by default this is an inline element that means it won't strech accross whole horizontal space. But this behaviour can be changed that by following css.
```css
sm-select{
  width: 100%;

#### Interactions

When `sm-strip-select` encounters an environment where only touch is supported it switches to touch based navigation like swipe scrolling and tapping. But when pointer like mouse is suppoted it switches to arrow button based navigation. 

#### Accessibility

### Tabs
[See Demo](https://sairaj-mote.github.io/components/)

```html
<sm-tabs></sm-tabs>
```

`<sm-tabs>` allows you to create tab based UI easily. It consists of mainly two components `<sm-tab>` and `<sm-panel>`. Every tab will have its corresponding panel that will be shown when tab is clicked.  

#### Syntax 
```html
<sm-tabs>
    <sm-tab slot="tab">Tab Title 1</sm-tab>
    <sm-panel slot="panel">
        //Body of panel
    </sm-panel>
 
    <sm-tab slot="tab">Tab Title 2</sm-tab>
    <sm-panel slot="panel">
        //Body of panel
    </sm-panel>
</sm-tabs>
```
Notice how every `sm-tab` is folloed by `sm-option`, This is default structure or syntax for using `sm-tabs`. ***If you didn't add a panel after a tab, the component won't work.***
Another key part is `sm-tab` should have `slot="tab"` as attribute and `slot="panel"` for `sm-panel`. As this component uses HTML5 ***[<slot>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot)*** tag to organize user added data.
